;;; Commentary:

;; This package uses "dub describe" to obtain a list of all
;; dependencies of a D dub project and sets the variable flycheck-dmd-include-paths
;; so that flycheck syntax checking knows how to call the compiler
;; and pass it include flags to find the dependencies

;; If it's not clear what any one function does, consult the unit tests
;; in the tests directory.

;; Usage:
;;
;;      (add-hook 'd-mode-hook 'flycheck-dmd-dub-set-include-path)
