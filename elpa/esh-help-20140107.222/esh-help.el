;;; Commentary:

;; This library adds the following help functions and support for Eshell:
;; - run-help function inspired by Zsh
;; - eldoc support
;;
;; To use this package, add these lines to your .emacs file:
;;     (require 'esh-help)
;;     (setup-esh-help-eldoc)  ;; To use eldoc in Eshell
;; And by using M-x eldoc-mode in Eshell, you can see help strings
;; for the pointed command in minibuffer.
;; And by using M-x esh-help-run-help, you can see full help string
;; for the command.
