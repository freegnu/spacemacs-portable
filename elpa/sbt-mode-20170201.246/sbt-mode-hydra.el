           "*** Sbt Hydra ***

Sbt Hydra offers convenient way for quick control of Sbt. It offers most used commands to be executed by single key.

Sbt Hydra consist of two parts. At the top is Projects section which contains list of projects from an sbt build.
At any given time one project is active. It is the one which name is in CAPITAL letters. Project can be swithed
by pressing appropriate key.

Most action provided are scoped by active project. For example key 'c' will trigger compilation of active project.

*** Project Hydra ***

Available actions:

A, B, C ...      - switch between project hydras, this part is generated dynamically on start by executing 'projects' command
                   in *sbt* buffer or it is populated by projects defined in `sbt-hydra:projects' Directory Local Variables

q - quit         - close hydra
c - compile      - execute 'compile' command for active project
y - test:compile - execute 'test:compile' command for active project
t - test         - execute 'test' command for active project
r - run          - execute 'run' command for active project
l - clean        - execute 'clean' command for active project
d - reload       - execute 'reload' command
e - eof          - send end-of-file character to the sbt prompt, useful for example for terminating running play application
i - edit         - edit last executed command and execute edited command
a - repeat       - repeat last executed command again
n - no-op        - execute 'name' command. This is convenient way how to prevent last command execute again. For example when
                   you don't want to execute test command again since it takes long time to finish
p - parse        - parse output of Sbt buffer for failed test. It must be run after 'test' command finish execution and there
                   are failed tests. In this case at the end of output is list of classes containing some failed tests.
                   This action will parse this classes names and it will create so called 'testHydra' which allow
                   run these classes only one by one.
o - testHydra    - switch to special hydra which is created by 'parse' action. More info in section 'Test Hydra'
u - testOnly     - run 'testOnly' command for active project with substring parameter (-- -z) containing text from the line point
                   is at. Works in Sbt buffer or Scala source file, but point must be at line contaning should text of the test.

*** Test Hydra ***

Available actions:

q - quit         - close hydra
o - back         - switch back to Sbt hydra
u - testOnly     - set substring (-- -z) for running one of defined test. By default use value from line point is at if this line
                   contains should text of the test
x - clean        - reset substring (-- -z) to empty string

[a] [b] [c] ...  - it run 'test:testOnly' for failed test optionally limited to (-- -z) substring. This section is generated
                   dynamically by the 'parse' action from project hydra.
