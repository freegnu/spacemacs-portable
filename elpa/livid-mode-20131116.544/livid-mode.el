;;; livid-mode.el --- Live browser eval of JavaScript every time a buffer changes

;; This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

;; Author: Murphy McMahon
;; URL: https://github.com/pandeiro/livid-mode
;; Package-Version: 20131116.544
;; Version: 0.1.0
;; Package-Requires: ((skewer-mode "1.5.3") (s "1.8.0"))

;;; Commentary:

;; This mode tries to create an environment similar to some online code editors
;; (such as jsbin or codepen), where JavaScript code in a buffer is evaluated
;; automatically every time it changes. However, in contrast to those tools,
;; the browser's state is not refreshed. The code is just evaluated, as if via the
;; browser's console.

;; By default, a buffer's code is first checked for syntax errors (using the
;; external `js` command) before actually being sent for evaluation.

;; Depends on skewer-mode and s. If livid-mode is activated in a buffer which is
;; not in skewer-mode already, skewer-mode is called.

;; As an alternative to turning the mode on and off, livid can be "paused"
;; (postponing any eval) with livid-pause, bound by default to C-c C-p.
