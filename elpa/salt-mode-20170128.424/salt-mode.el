;;; Commentary:

;; GNU Emacs major mode for editing Salt States.

;; Provides syntax highlighting, indentation, and jinja templating.

;; Syntax highlighting: Fontification supports YAML & Jinja using mmm-mode

;; Tag complete: Using mmm-mode you can generate insert templates:
;; C-c % {
;;   generates {{ _ }} with cursor where the underscore is
;; C-c % #
;; C-c % %
;;   for {# and {% as well.
