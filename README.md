# spacemacs-portable
A snapshot of spacemacs through time for those behind the firewall

## Installation instructions
Download the zip file of the master branch if your corporate firewall allows or email the zip to yourself if allowed
Copy the elpa directory from the zip to your .emacs.d directory or your spacemacs HOME directory
Run emacs (on Windows literally runemacs.exe)
Ignore all the errors on start up and use Spacemacs

Please feel free to help out on getting rid of the errors. Which I think I think can be fixed via configuration settings.
